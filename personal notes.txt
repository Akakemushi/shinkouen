Notes for the Shinkoen Website and general learning from the experience.

Models recommended for setting up an online shop are:
1. the product model (teapot)
2. the cart model (temporary storage for items, does not get saved in db)
3. the order model (just like cart model, but only created once checkout is confirmed, saved in db, joins a user to a group of line items)
4. the "Line Item" model (join table for items and orders, saved in db)
5. the category model (maybe optional? used to organize items better somehow...come back later)
6. the user model (self explanatory, but can include an "annoymous" function to handle those without accounts)
7. the review model (self explanatory)

Pagy Installation
first you need the gem, then you need to follow some installation steps (which I forgot)
right now I'm troubleshooting...
First you need to include the line "include Pagy::Frontend" in the relevant "helper" module.
also, I seem to require two files, pagy.js and pagy.css, which I had to manually create inside the app/javascript  and app/assets/stylesheets folders respectively... the files are blank, but that's ok I guess?

picture filename are CaSe SenSiTive!  Even the .suffix!  .PNG does NOT equal .PNG

==============Q U I C K   L O O K U P S======================
- gco -b name     to create a new branch.  Need the -b for a new one.

==============P  R  O  B  L  E  M  S===================

ISSUE: new SCSS files stop working even after hard refreshing, styles aren't applied at all.
FIXED: try closing the server and running     rails assets:clobber     in the cli, then restart the server.

ISSUE:  Money.new(teapot.price, "JPY").format   seems to return a string, however when I try to modify the array, I can't save a string to an integer field.  It reads as a zero when displayed
FIXED:  Altered the MODEL by adding a method which returns the formated string version of its own price.

ISSUE:  Getting rid of the lame underlines on hyperlinks
FIXED: You need to set text-decoration: none; on NOT ONLY the tag, but also its variants  a:visited   a:link   a:hover    a:active

ISSUE:  <p> elements that are children (not even direct children) of a wrapping link are being styled/decorated like links.
FIXED:  I changed the root design of <a> and <p> tags in the main stylesheet. That seemed to overwrite the problem.

ISSUE:  Trying to implement a fading carousel for the index page, but having lots of issues.  Currently working on "carousel" branch.  GPT says use
Jquery, but I can't seem to get that to work?  browser console doesn't recognize the $ needed in Jquery.

Tousan Notes
If priced over, 5man over, show more photos
photos should automatically rotate

many photos with only picture, price, and artist
each picture should automatically switch when hovered over,
at least 3 photos,
one is from the Frontend
one is with the lid open
one is the maker's maker
