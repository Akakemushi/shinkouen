Notes for the Shinkoen Website and general learning from the experience.

Models recommended for setting up an online shop are:
1. the product model (teapot)
2. the cart model (temporary storage for items, does not get saved in db)
3. the order model (just like cart model, but only created once checkout is confirmed, saved in db, joins a user to a group of line items)
4. the "Line Item" model (join table for items and orders, saved in db)
5. the category model (maybe optional? used to organize items better somehow...come back later)
6. the user model (self explanatory, but can include an "annoymous" function to handle those without accounts)
7. the review model (self explanatory)

Pagy Installation
first you need the gem, then you need to follow some installation steps (which I forgot)
right now I'm troubleshooting...
First you need to include the line "include Pagy::Frontend" in the relevant "helper" module.
also, I seem to require two files, pagy.js and pagy.css, which I had to manually create inside the app/javascript  and app/assets/stylesheets folders respectively... the files are blank, but that's ok I guess?
